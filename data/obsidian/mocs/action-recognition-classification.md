# Action Recognition & Classification

This research area focuses on correctly identifying and categorizing human actions or events within trimmed or continuous video streams [1-3].

## Skeleton-Based and Pose-Guided Methods

Architectures that leverage human pose topology and joint coordinates, rather than raw pixels, to model dynamic movement [4, 5].

## Open Problems

Based on the sources, researchers in the field of **Action Recognition & Classification** face several ongoing challenges, ranging from extreme data dependency to computational bottlenecks and dataset biases. 

Here are the specific unsolved problems, limitations, and future research directions identified:

**1. Data Scarcity and Annotation Costs**
*   **The Problem:** Deep learning models are notoriously data-hungry. Requiring large, manually tagged datasets for every new action category makes these models impractical for real-world applications where data is rare or expensive to collect [1, 2]. Furthermore, providing frame-by-frame bounding box annotations to train models on spatial localization is incredibly expensive and scales poorly [3].
*   **Future Directions:** A major research focus is on **few-shot learning** (e.g., TAEN, STRM), which aims to accurately classify new actions using only 1 to 5 examples [1, 2, 4]. Another direction is developing self-supervised networks (like ActionFlowNet) that learn motion representations directly from raw pixels, eliminating the need for pre-training on massive labeled datasets [5].

**2. High Computational Complexity**
*   **The Problem:** While architectures like 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) effectively capture spatial and temporal features, they are highly parameter-heavy and computationally expensive [6, 7]. Additionally, in few-shot temporal modeling, comparing frame sequences across query and support videos becomes computationally infeasible as the sequence length scales up [8].

**3. "Static Bias" and Background Distraction**
*   **The Problem:** A significant limitation in standard action recognition datasets (such as Kinetics) is the phenomenon of **"static bias."** Filter analysis reveals that models often "cheat" by relying heavily on static background appearance or context to classify an action, rather than actually learning the temporal motion dynamics [9, 10]. 
*   **The Problem:** Similarly, spatial attention mechanisms can be unstable. Instead of focusing strictly on the actor, attention networks frequently wander and trigger on irrelevant background contexts, leading to shaky localization unless temporal smoothing is applied [11].

**4. Modeling Complex and Variable Tempos**
*   **The Problem:** Actions exhibit massive intra-class and inter-class variances in visual tempos (the speed at which an action is performed) [12]. Furthermore, complex human actions are rarely uniform; they are composed of evolving sub-actions that are difficult for standard video-level constraints to capture dynamically [13].

**5. Limitations of Pose-Guided Architectures**
*   **The Problem:** Skeleton and pose-attention networks (like RPAN) provide excellent robustness to occlusion, but their current limitation is a strict reliance on datasets that have pose annotations available during the training phase [14].
*   **Future Directions:** Researchers aim to extend these methods to larger action recognition datasets *without* explicit pose annotations [14]. A key future goal is to unify the pipeline, solving both action recognition and detailed pose estimation simultaneously within the same network [14].

**6. Rigid Network Structures vs. Adaptive Learning**
*   **The Problem:** Traditional deep neural networks have fixed structures (a set number of layers and connections). This rigidness makes them poorly suited for continuous, adaptive learning or for transparently extracting interpretable knowledge from spatial-temporal data [15].
*   **Future Directions:** Brain-inspired **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** are proposed as a future direction because they self-organize recurrent connections dynamically based on incoming data [16, 17]. However, SNNs face their own major unsolved problem: **parameter optimization**. SNNs are highly sensitive, and even tiny changes to their parameters can cause the entire network to crash or drastically alter its behavior [18]. Finding efficient, stable optimization algorithms for SNNs remains an open challenge [18, 19].
