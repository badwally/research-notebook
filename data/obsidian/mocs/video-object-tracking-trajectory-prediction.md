## Open Problems

**Robust Re-identification and Long-Term Identity Tracking**
A major technical hurdle that remains in the field is robust re-identification—the capacity to consistently recognize whether an object in one frame is the exact same object minutes later [1]. Traditional tracking-by-detection frameworks struggle with this because they separate spatial and temporal information into two stages, which prevents comprehensive feature processing and makes the models brittle when facing occlusions [2, 3]. Furthermore, traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods often rely on strict confidence thresholds to filter outputs, which inevitably causes them to lose tracks of targets that experience high portions of occlusion [4]. While new vision-language models excel at grounding, tracking consistency over time across extended contexts is still their definitive bottleneck [1, 5]. 

**Trajectory Modeling Limitations in Space and Time**
Current geometric and temporal modeling techniques face structural constraints:
*   **Linear Constraints:** Methods that utilize 3D "bounding tubes" (such as TubeTK) to unify spatial and temporal positions are inherently limited because these tubes can only fit linear trajectories [6]. Consequently, they must be kept very short, as they cannot naturally model complex, non-linear long-term movements [6].
*   **Temporal Memory Limits:** For models that use external memory to store tracking history (like Recurrent Autoregressive Networks), temporal scalability is a challenge. Research shows that tracking performance converges after considering about 10 historical time steps, indicating a limit to how far back memory is actually useful [7].
*   **Insufficient Context Windows:** Point-based methods (such as CenterTrack) often only use two frames to extract spatio-temporal context [8]. This is insufficient for tracking objects that dynamically change shape or appear to merge and separate, such as biological cells [8]. Additionally, many tracking methods ignore the spatial context *outside* the bounding boxes, missing critical environmental clues [8].

**Flawed Ground Truth and Annotation Artifacts**
The advancement of tracking models is currently hindered by the quality of the tracking data itself. Researchers note a specific weakness in advanced datasets where the "point marker" for a tracked object flickers—meaning the annotated location changes slightly from frame to frame even if the actual object has not moved [5]. Because the ground truth data itself is inconsistent, it becomes incredibly difficult for tracking models to learn absolute consistency and perfect trajectory mapping [5].

**Adaptivity and Constraints for Mobile Platforms**
In specialized domains like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and mobile robotics, researchers point out that pre-defined regularizations used in many trackers lose their adaptivity during active, online tracking [9]. Furthermore, many existing methods disregard tracking speed and computational efficiency, making them entirely unsuited for the power and processing constraints of mobile platforms [9].

**Future Research Directions**
*   **Solving Absolute Consistency:** A primary future goal is achieving absolute point marker consistency and flawless object identity tracking across frames [5, 10]. Overcoming this specific tracking bottleneck is necessary to unlock reliable, general-purpose autonomous applications, including large-scale traffic monitoring, complex sports analytics, and surgical robotics [10].
*   **Aerial and Robotic Integration:** The specific applications of aerial tracking within autonomous robotics remain an area that needs further investigation and development, particularly focusing on automatic spatio-temporal regularization that operates efficiently on CPUs [9].
